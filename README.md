This is the inception of the JSRP Controller. The controller will be used to connect MAX/MSP to Unity and to smart phones to create a gameplay/walkthrough using impulse responses taking from a local church. 

The project will be completed in september and this will chronicle the development of the patch. 

Any questions, please feel free to contact me.
